## Key Decisions Made

- **Stack:** Node/Express/TS + React/Vite/Tailwind/shadcn/wouter + Postgres/Drizzle (consistent with other 360 Studio Suite apps)
- **Auth:** Passport.js session-based (same pattern as VFXTracker, ADRSessionManager)
- **AI:** Multi-provider layer (Claude primary, OpenAI + DeepSeek secondary) with `ai_orchestrator` module
- **Cloud Storage:** Dropbox API first, extensible to Google Drive
- **Smart Links:** Custom redirect service at `watch.otheranimal.app/{slug}`
- **Film Metadata:** OMDb API auto-import on title creation
- **Port:** TBD (VFXTracker=5001, ADRSessionManager=5002, next likely 5003)
- **DB:** PostgreSQL database `oae_marketing`, admin: `admin`/`oaeadmin2024`

## Open Questions

- [ ] What port should this run on? (5003?)
- [ ] Do we need a separate redirect microservice for `watch.otheranimal.app` or is it part of the main app?
- [ ] Dropbox — team account or personal? What's the root folder structure currently?
- [ ] Will OMDb API key be shared across Studio Suite apps or per-app?
- [ ] Hosting target: same Proxmox LXC as other apps?
